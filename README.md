# iRedMail-Upgrader

Because iRedMail shouldn't be annoying to keep up to date.

Focusing on Debian's edition for now, may split up into different support later (Mostly because I want to move to Alma Linux anyway).

Just run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HotelLima521/iRedMail-Upgrader; cd iRedMail-Upgrader; ./update.sh
```
